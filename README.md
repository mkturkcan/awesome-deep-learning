# awesome-deep-learning
A mini-blog repository of cool projects to try out, and to check out by everyone!

## Introduction

The speed at which the field of deep learning is evolving is just incredible these days! Normally I put my list of "hot stuff to check out" in my personal research log, but why not make it available for everyone? This is the repository for this!

* Mixtral-8x7B https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1

Small language model with great results! I would specifically recommend it as an alternative to ChatGPT 4 for writing as it uses a significantly different style, with different metaphors and similes.

* moondream1 https://huggingface.co/vikhyatk/moondream1 
1.6B parameter vision-to-text model. Ideal for Jetson deployment.

* InstantID https://huggingface.co/InstantX/InstantID
A model for single-image face replacement. In my experience these models don't tend to work well for everyone, and are not yet ready for direct deployment to apps.

* Whisper v3 https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3
A must-have for audio-based downstream classification/regression/retrieval/ranking tasks! Combine with wav2vec2 and a downstream classifier/regressor/ranker model to achieve great results!
