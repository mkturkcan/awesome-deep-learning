# Awesome Contemporary Deep Learning Topics
A mini-blog repository of cool projects to try out, and to check out by everyone!

## Introduction

The speed at which the field of deep learning is evolving is just incredible these days! Normally I put my list of "hot stuff to check out" in my personal research log, but why not make it available for everyone? This is the repository for this!

### April 1, 2024

Many cool projects today!

* Dust3r https://github.com/naver/dust3r

Incredible results even for badly calibrated scenes!

* Metric3D https://github.com/YvanYin/Metric3D

Monocular metric depth estimation is very useful for a large variety of downstream applications!

* Adaptive-RAG: Learning to Adapt Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models through Question Complexity https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14403

Awaiting the source code release!

* Duolando https://github.com/lisiyao21/Duolando

Excellent project, a lot of work!

More 3D!

* Stable Video 3D https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv3d

* LucidDreamer https://luciddreamer-cvlab.github.io/ 


### March 16, 2024

It's time for 3D reconstruction models!

* TripoSR https://github.com/VAST-AI-Research/TripoSR

Fast method for low-resolution 3D model generation. Good results without the Janus problem.

### February 2, 2024

Just links to some really cool projects today!

* YOLO-World: Real-Time Open-Vocabulary Object Detection https://github.com/ailab-cvc/yolo-world

Open vocabulary YOLO! Very useful for real time approaches.

* WhisperSpeech https://github.com/collabora/WhisperSpeech 

High quality, customizable text-to-speech!

* SUPIR: Scaling Up to Excellence: Practicing Model Scaling for Photo-Realistic Image Restoration In the Wild https://github.com/Fanghua-Yu/SUPIR 

Image restoration in the wild is really difficult. Any good model in this space is really valuable for using AI in entertainment and history!

### February 1, 2024

Here, I won't necessarily only talk about models that have *just* been released, but will also add interesting models. I have been interested in image and video restoration in the last few days, and today's update focuses on this.

* Bringing Old Films Back to Life https://github.com/raywzy/Bringing-Old-Films-Back-to-Life 

A great model for restoring videos! A very important problem with the repository is that colorization models were never released, which means one needs to use a different colorization model. Great to use at the start of the video processing pipeline.

* GFPGAN https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN

Easy-to-install model for face restoration with great results! Comes combined with ESRGAN for super-resolution. Note that there have been many improvements in this space, with Codeformer being a good replacement.

* RestoreFormer++ https://github.com/wzhouxiff/RestoreFormerPlusPlus

GFPGAN repository contains RestoreFormer as an option, but this model is new! On my TODO list for models to check out.

* CodeFormer https://github.com/sczhou/CodeFormer

Another excellent, easy-to-install model for face restoration.

* DeOldify https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify 

Despite being old, this remains an open source video colorization approach that could be implemented quickly for restoration of old clips.

* Colorization Transformer https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/coltran 

An older model for colorization. Interesting for a read, though I have not had success with it.


### January 28, 2024

* Mixtral-8x7B https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1

Small language model with great results! I would specifically recommend it as an alternative to ChatGPT 4 for writing as it uses a significantly different style, with different metaphors and similes, and is able to follow prompts better than ChatGPT 3.5.

* moondream1 https://huggingface.co/vikhyatk/moondream1 

1.6B parameter vision-to-text model. Ideal for Jetson deployment.

* InstantID https://huggingface.co/InstantX/InstantID

A model for single-image face replacement. In my experience these models don't tend to work well for everyone, and are not yet ready for direct deployment to apps.

* Whisper v3 https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3

A must-have for audio-based downstream classification/regression/retrieval/ranking tasks! Combine with wav2vec2 and a downstream classifier/regressor/ranker model to achieve great results!
